Roman,

Your hackathon project is ambitious and includes topics we didnâ€™t even cover in class â€” very impressive!
The project is well-executed and well-built.
Your code is clean, readable, and very well structured.

Youâ€™ve successfully used all the topics we learned in class and even went beyond that.
One suggestion: try to add more comments to your code to make it easier for others to read and understand.

Very good job! ðŸ™Œ
